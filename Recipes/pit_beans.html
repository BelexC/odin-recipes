    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These beans are sweet, smoky and meaty. They are hearty and the perfect side and compliment for any backyard BBQ. This recipe is one my buddy Michael Letchworth, partner at Sam Jones BBQ, cooks at our annual Memorial Day Whole Hog party. He has been cooking this with Sam's family since his days at the legendary Skylight Inn.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 3 lb, 7 oz can Bush's Baked Beans</li>
        <li>1 lb ground meat</li>
        <li>16 ounces of your favorite sweet bbq sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 sweet onion, diced</li>
        <li>1/2 bell pepper, diced</li>
        <li>Meat Church The Gospel (sub Texas Sugar, Honey Hog, Holy Gospel, Honey Bacon or Deez Nuts)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your smoker at a temperature of 250 degrees. I recommend a smoking wood or pellet such as oak, mesquite, hickory or pecan. In this video we used post oak in a Mill Scale 94 gallon offset smoker. </li>
        <li>While your smoker is coming to temperature, prepare your grill for direct, high heat cooking. This step could also be accomplished on a stove top.</li>
        <li>Add some cooking oil to a hot cast iron skillet. Sauté the onion and bell pepper until translucent.</li>
        <li>Add the ground beef. Incorporate with the onion and pepper. Season with Meat Church The Gospel BBQ Seasoning. Continue cooking until the ground meat is at least 165 internal temperature.</li>
        <li>Remove the pan from the heat. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add the beans and sweet bbq sauce to the sautéed mixture.</li>
        <li>Season with more The Gospel.</li>
        <li>Mix to incorporate throughly.</li>
        <li>Place the pan in the smoker.</li>
        <li>Cook for 2 - 4 hours uncovered, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>If you are in a hurry, you can cook at 375 for 30 minutes</li>
        <li>When you have smoked the pit beans for your desire amount of time, remove from the smoker and allow to cook. Enjoy one of my favorite side dishes for every BBQ!</li>
    </ol>
