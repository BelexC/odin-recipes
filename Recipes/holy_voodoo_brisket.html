    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Recently a gentlemen told me he followed my brisket method and turned out the best brisket he had ever made. When I asked if he seasoned with Holy Cow, he replied, “No, Holy Voodoo.” My mind was blown! I had been hearing more and more people say a Voodoo brisket was great, so we decided to put it to a proper test. And it did not fail us!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 full packer brisket</li>
        <li>1Meat Church Holy Voodoo Rub</li>
        <li>Coarse black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare your smoker to a temperature of 225 with oak, mesquite or hickory.</li>
        <li>Trim the full packer brisket to your liking.</li>
        <li>Season the brisket moderately with black pepper. Then season liberally with Meat Church Holy Cow. Allow to adhere for at least 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place the brisket in your smoker fat side up. </li>
        <li>Smoke at 225 for 7 hours.</li>
        <li>Increase the temp to 250 and smoke for 2 hours. Wrap when you obtain great bark.</li>
        <li>Then wrap in unwaxed butcher paper and return to the smoker.</li>
        <li>Increase the temp to 275 to render out those last fats. Smoke until the flat is probe tender which is typically around 203 internal temp.</li>
        <li>Remove from the smoker. Allow to rest at ambient temperature on the counter for 2 hours. At this point you can slice and eat it.</li>
    </ol>
